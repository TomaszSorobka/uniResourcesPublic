/**
 * Quick description
 *  The program calculates a sequence of all the cans in the back
 *  of the truck, that, when used, does not lead to the truck stopping at any of the
 *  places where stopping is not possible.
 * 
 * Usage: 
 * Firstly, input an integer n that is a number of cans in the back of the truck.
 * Then input n integers separated with spaces that correspond to the number of kilometers
 * that a truck can go when fueled solely by n-th can.
 * Lastly, input n - 1 integers separated with spaces that correspond to the places where stopping
 * is not allowed. The integers are the numbers of kilometers that such a place is from the start.
 * 
 * After that, the program will output the sequence of all cans, which meet the restrictions
 * of the program, namely: all the cans have to be used and the car cannot stop to refuel
 * on places that were indicated in the input.
